          <h4>Our lives revolve around music. We relate to it, we react to it, we sing to it. We may not always see its importance, but it is always in our presence. If not heard, it is thought about, if not important to us, it carries us through every step of the way. That is the beauty of music, no one can ever take it away. Take advantage of free advice from a song writer, retrieve emotions, and know that this melody can never hurt you. -Anonymous

Going to live shows takes the music to a whole new level of enjoyment. 2015 was a great year in music. There was a wide array of releases each unique in their own way. I went to 50 shows throughout the year and saw many more artists/bands than that. Here are my thoughts on 25 of my favorties this year. I hope you enjoy. Go listen. Go watch. Go discuss. Go enjoy

            <h4 class="modal-title">Allen Stone: Radius</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Allen Stone has always been a purest and appreciative of music in its most organic form, music that makes you groove. Soul music has always hit all those marks: "Soul music is more of a feeling than it is a sound. Soul exists in a tone and an authenticity...I wanted to get into soul music because of the way it felt, which was very authentic." His obsession with and comparison too soul's greatest, that include Stevie Wonder, Al Green, and Prince, have made him a sweater bearing hippie who appreciates retro and is hesitant to dive in to where music is today.</p>
            
<p>He even fights that notion in "Fake Future" by encouraging us to "chuck our laptops" and ask: "What good is my microphone if I don't really sing?/ What good is my music if it ain't really me?" However, the part that makes Radius great is that Stone never clings too tightly to the past and wonderfully toes the line of paying homage in a fresh and new way.</p>
            
<p>"The radius is the distance between the center point of a circle to its exterior," Stone explains. "This record really is a description, a definition, a correlation - whatever you want to call it - between the center of me and my being, to my exterior." This line perfectly encapsulates the album because for any of us there is a wide range of emotions circling around our inner and outer selves and this is no different for Stone.</p>
            
<p>The aforementioned "Fake Future" finds Stone worried about technology. "Circle" speaks of being trapped in hopelessness and fear. "Where You're At" asks us all to appreciate the good things that we have. All of these topics sit atop a historical lesson on soul music with the added touch of that fancy technology that Stone treats with trepidation. Vocally, Stone is as crisp as ever as his voice soars per usual, carrying over that charisma that was gained as a kid spending his days leading the choir for his father's church.
When asked about what his goal was for the record Stone stated: "When I set out to make this record I really wanted to find my own individual spectrum of music. I think I've found it. It's this weird, white funk meets Northwest soul." Take one listen and that odd sentence will make perfectly good sense

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The Japanese practice of Kintsugi is a ceramic process in which fragmented pieces are melded together with liquefied or dusted metals like gold and silver. The end product obviously depends on the original state of the fragmented pieces, but ultimately the fractured pieces make for a more beautiful, structurally sound whole. <em>Kintsugi</em> the album is Ben Gibbard and Death Cab For Cutie's attempt at finding their end piece of art.</p>
              
<p>17 years into their career there has always been an overarching theme of growing up in Death Cab's unique brand of indie. Over the years it has evolved from the overinflated moments of young age into the nuanced moments of adulthood. No matter what stage in life there will always be a sense of trying to find yourself and establish meaningful connections. Couple those themes with the departure of founding member Chris Walla and, for Gibbard personally, the very public divorce with Zooey Deschanel and you certainly have your fragmented pieces. And to keep the metaphor going the music is the liquefied metal needed to create the new piece of art! My goodness I get it now!</p>
              
<p>There is a certain voyeuristic uneasiness, very similar to Bjork's <em>Vulnicura,</em> when you hear lines like "Darling, though you may pretend that you are selfless/You break with but the slightest bend and it leaves you lost and helpless" or "You'll never have to hear the word 'no'/If you keep all your friends on the payroll." The beauty of music is that you can choose to interpret it your own way. "Little Wanderer" finds the protagonist hoping to be a beacon to a globe-trotting lover. Is that about Zooey? Probably, but it doesn't have to be. The songs also stand perfectly as their own narrative and offer more than any Hollywood love story can offer. Ultimately, <em>Kintsugi</em> is an album about drifting apart and a band trying to stay together. It is the many moments of survival that we come across over and over again as we get older. The next step is to take the pieces and make something beautiful out of it.

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>When a band launches from obscurity and releases a fully-formed and dynamic debut album there is always a cautious hesitancy about what they may do next. In 2013, CHVRCHES jumped out of Glasgow and straight on top of the 80's synth-pop wave. <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em> was confident, piercing, and furious. The trio relentlessly toured the album over the better of two years and in that time their crowds and stages grew bigger and they grew more confident as they found their legs as live performers.</p>
            
<p>Artists often take different routes to avoid the dreaded "sophomore slump" to various results. Some can be too ambitious, not ambitious enough, or experiment with a new sound trying to capture the magic the launched them into the spotlight. CHVRCHES decided that they wanted to take everything they learned on the road and stay exactly as they were. The result is <em>Every Open Eye</em> and it takes every sincere, big, and melodic hallmark of <em>Bones</em> and injects a new confidence and efficiency.
</p>
            
<p>CHVRCHES have crafted an album for the live audience. They have figured out what works and took it to the max. The hooks are big and clean. The songs never rush, but perfectly approach their climax. Let's take a look at album highlight "Clearest Blue." It has no standard pop structure. You won't find a chorus, but what you will find is an ultra-confident Lauren Mayberry whose vocals soar with a fragile tension as the lush arrangement dances around her with an ever increasing build. And then the coveted drop hits you, not in a cheesy EDM manner, but in a surging, monumental, keyboard riff that channels Depeche Mode. These moments are all over the album. From the waste-no-time opener "Never Ending Circles" or the glittery sparkle of "Leave a Trace" to the way in which Mayberry stretches out the word gold in "Make Them Gold."</p>
            
<p>Speaking of Mayberry, there is a complete confidence in her vocals and delivery. Early on in CHVRCHES' run Mayberry struggled to find her way on stage and the trials that come from being a popular female in the music industry. Over the last two years she has not only gained her chops on stage, but has relentlessly come after misogynistic online trolls and audience hecklers. Not letting anyone get away with has gone on too long in the business. To see this confidence come full form in this album is what makes it so good. You keep doing you CHVRCHES and we will continue to ride along.</p>

            <p>Florence Welch is an absolute force. Both in her voice, ambition, and performances on stage. It seemed like the only person capable of stopping Florence and her Machine was Florence herself. And that is exactly what happened at this year's Coachella when she jumped off the stage and broke her foot. As painful and frustrating as I am sure that was for Welch, especially considering she was just starting to promote the album, it forced her to relax for just a little bit of time. In the weeks after the injury she resorted to a stool for performances and the songs were re-arranged to follow suit.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that I believe the injury helped us prepare ourselves for Welch's best and most complete album. There are the triumphant and dominant moments that the Machine has been known for, but there is a new eloquence and fragility. On previous albums it seems like there was grandeur for the sake of grandeur and none of that is present here. A lot of that is due to producer Markus Dravs (Arcade Fire, Bjork, Coldplay). He wanted to strip these songs down as much as possible and pick his spots of impact. You see this play out in the immediacy of the acoustic drums and backbeat of "Ship to Wreck" or the electronic atmospherics that begin "What Kind of Man" before it launches into a chunky guitar riff and arena sized drum kick.</p>
            
<p>The appearance of more mellow tracks helps with the fact that this is a relationship record for Welch and very introspective. "Various Storms and Saints" and "Long and Lost" are low key while the former veils commentary on her relationship through biblical reference as she is apt to do while the latter is completely straight forward. Even the title track is mellow before the career defining moment when the Goldfrapp led 36 piece string and brass section takes it to new heights.</p>
            
<p>I had the pleasure of seeing Florence both during the broken foot and after it was healed. The first performance gave a new and different life to her music that shows itself on this album. I am not sure if it is in her plans, seeing as performance two she was a maniac and all over the place, but if she ever did decide to do an acoustic tour it would be a joy to hear these songs played in that format.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Son Lux: Bones</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Ryan Lott, the mastermind behind all things Son Lux, keeps himself a busy man. The innovative, classically trained, beat-making, composer has spent his time creating imaginative and complex music across all mediums. He has scored for TV, film, dance, and collaborated with the likes of Beyonce producer Boots, Sufjan Stevens, and Richard Reed Parry of Arcade Fire. All that to say that the man has a lot of ideas in his head and he uses Son Lux to help get those ideas out.</p>
            
<p>A solo endeavor in the past, Lott has hired his live companions guitarist Rafiq Bhatia and drummer Ian Chang for <em>Bones</em>. This was a fantastic move on Lott's part because having seen Son Lux three times I can say Chang and Bhatia are some of the most unique musicians out there today. The newly formed trio has allowed Son Lux to push boundaries even further than before.</p>
            
<p>At the onset, Son Lux music is in no way easy listening. A mind like Lotts simply doesn't construct traditional song frameworks. <em>Bones</em> dives deep into dark waters. The grab bag of genre and influence gets mixed around until it becomes controlled chaos. It is often times something you can't wrap your head around, but will certainly get stuck in there anyways. The music toes the line between electronic jazz pop and classical arrangements. The constant struggle between the two adds an additional character to the music that isn’t seen in other types of music. Trust me when I say the hooks are all over the place, it just takes some time to find them.</p>
            
<p>Having musicians in the studio this time around has created a sense that they are adapting in real time to the artificial instruments and choppy samples that Lott throws out at them. It's as if Lott is saying "Alright here comes this shift from minimalism to bombastic maximialism, let's see what they do with this." "This Time" is Latin-meets-indsutrial in which Chang bounces syncopated drums off of the machine like backbeat. All to be capped off by a nine-person choir because why not? "Undone" finds Rafiq using slick, soulful, jazz guitar runs.</p>
            
<p>Lott's vocals are often times sparse for good reason. He takes the vocals-as-instrument approach that aims to slot in with the music instead of being laid on top of it. Lyrically he speaks introspectively about life and personal longing. Lead single "Change is Everything" is an awesome play on words discussing the tiny moments in life that become major turning points. Speaking of that song, I want to close with demanding you look at the linked video for the song. It is stop motion from drawings created with pins and strings. It is unbelievable and I don't understand how people have the time and patience to pull it off. Enjoy.

            <h4 class="modal-title">Adele: 25</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Adele is officially queen of the world. I talked to some people and confirmed this. Seeing as this album is a super-mega-ginormous critical success there isn't much value added in discussing the details of the songs and music because everyone has already heard it many times over. As a result I will use this space to do some free form discussion on craziness of this album and its impact on the music industry.<p>
            
<p>As of this writing Adele's first week numbers have just come out and they are officially listed at a whopping 3.38 million copies! This blows away the previous mark set by N*SYNC's 2.42 million in sales of <em>No Strings Attached.</em> To see these numbers in 2015 is just something truly remarkable.  In a time where singles and curated playlists dominate the music scene, not to mention the availability of streaming and single song downloads, how was Adele able to pull this off?<p>
            
<p>To me there are many reasons for this. The first is that the album is really good and Adele has a once in a lifetime voice. The second and probably biggest factor is that Adele is a cross-generational, cross-cultural, cross-genre etc. etc. talent. Her music is cool enough for the millennials and hipsters and safe enough for the soccer moms to pick up at Target and spin on the way to AYSO.  Why do you think the latest <em>Now</em> compilation shows up on the billboard top whatever? It is because there is still a ton of people (likely older) who don't have time for Spotify or iTunes and come across their music during their weekly trip to WalMart. If you couple that with the millennials who can't find the album on Spotify or Apple Music and have now bought their second album in five years (Taylor Swift being the first) you have 3.38 million copies! It is crazy how much dominance this album has had to all forms of music listeners in such a small amount of time.</p>
            
<p>To briefly touch on the subject of her keeping it off streaming services it was much more of a business decision than anything. Despite what some people have written, I don't think it marks any significant shift in people buying albums or the demise of streaming. These cases are few and far in between. The fact that One Direction, Bieber, and Adele crushed sales for two weeks doesn't indicate a seismic shift. It is just statistics people. Anomalies happen. Adele will eventually put the albums on streaming after sales die down and if anything this is the tactic that might gain traction. If you want to hear the music when it comes out you will have to pay a premium or else you wait until later. It is no different than seeing a movie in theaters vs. waiting for it to drop onto Netflix. For 99% of artists streaming is another one of many options not previously available to make money. I completely agree they don't make enough from these services (that should change with time) and album sales are down, but there is money to be made. In 2015 you can make it without a label, make money off numerous physical media, make money on social media, make money off streaming etc. etc.<p>
            
<p>If I can add anything to the music itself it would be to take a look at the co-writers on the album. It is always fun with big albums like this to discover who helped write the music and listen to it through a new lens. "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)" is co-written by mega-producer Max Martin. "River Lea" features Danger Mouse. Personal favorite "When we were Young" is with Tobias Jesso Jr. who you will hear from shortly. Throw open the Wikipedia and there is all types of cool stuff you can discover about the writing process. While you do that Adele will continue to reign supreme on this land of ours.

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Over the years there are 5 songwriters that I have become absolute favorites of mine. My for-no-reason-at-all criteria include:<p>
<p>1)	They go by their own name</p>
<p>2)	If not exclusively by their name they must have had multiple bands</p>
<p>3)	Are a part of my era of music listening<p>
            
<p>2015 has been a banner year for all those songwriters. Andrew McMahon released a 10 year version of <em>Everything in Transit</em> and re-issued a deluxe version of his In the Wilderness debut while Ryan Adams released a behemoth <em>Live at Carnegie Hall</em> Album and a let's-not-get-into-it cover album of Taylor Swift. Neither one of them released new material so you won't find it on this list but the other two will be found later on this list (how about that for drama?). To round out the top 5 is the rock and roller himself Butch mother effing Walker.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with Butch Walker then a) you have a lot of work to do and b) it is important to know that he is a musical shape shifter. He started his career fronting the hair metal and power-pop bands SouthGang and Marvelous 3 before moving onto a prolific solo career producing top-40 hits and releasing albums on his own. His solo albums have ranged from country and alternative to glam rock and 80's hair metal ballads. His producer credits include songs for Katy Perry, Weezer, Saosin, Gavin DeGraw, Pink, Taylor Swift, Fall Out Boy and on and on and on. Butch works on whatever interests him and is damn good at it.<p>

<p>At the crux of his ever-changing sound is that Walker is a superb songwriter and <em>Afraid of Ghosts</em> finds Walker at his most vulnerable, subdued, and reflective. Produced by whom else but Ryan Adams the album is largely based on the death of his father and his reflection of life as a result. <em>Ghosts</em> is easily Walkers most calm, sparse, and intimate album. After first listen it is immediately apparent it is an album he had to make. Album climax "Father's Day" tells you all you need to know about the albums content: "Sunday Morning, Father's Day / The first without my dad / As I look into my little boy's eyes / It takes all I have / Not to break down right in front of him when he smiles at me / You don't become a man / Until you lose your dad, you see."</p>
            
<p>Musically, Walker and Adams work together and bring out what each of them does best. The piano-tinged folk of the title track and the steel-pedal quietness of "How are things, Love?" give way to the mellow side of classic rock found in "I love you" or the cathartic guitar solo closing out "Father's Day." Walker is a man who dresses up in many musical costumes, but <em>Afraid of Ghosts</em> is a welcome change into his everyday threads as he reflects on the important aspects of life.</p>

            <p>"We had the biggest single in the world last time and didn't have the biggest album. This time we wanted to stop worrying about singles and focus on having a critically acclaimed album." Think about that statement as you hear the synthesized battlecry that kicks off opening track "Run Away With Me" and launches you into the pop perfection that is Jepsen's <em>EMOTION</em>.
Wait, why are you laughing? I am completely serious. I freaking love this album.<p>
            
<p>The above quote is from Jepsen's manager Scooter Braun and it very clearly explains Jepsen's intention of breaking from the viscous one-hit-wonder cycle that has threatened her after "Call Me Maybe" sprung out of Canada and took my heart by storm (I kid, but that song was great). The Jepsen team challenged the world's best pop minds to show them what they got and the result is a solid and spotless album. More than 200 tracks were workshopped and only 12 ended up making the cut. When you are turning down tracks from Max Martin and Jack Antonoff you know the competition is fierce<p>
            
<p>While the lyrical content may veer in various different directions and ultimately be about nothing important at all, each songs has a mood of triumph as we see the best of the winning writers and producers. The hit-list includes: Shellback (go look at his song credits, it's absurd), Rostam Batmanlij (Vampire Weekend), Dev Hynes (Blood Orange and everything else that is awesome), Sia (from the band Sia), and Daniel Nigro (please come back As Tall As Lions).</p>
            
<p>The production continuously hits hard, but with so many different voices it maintains a volume of spontaneity that adds to the perfectly structured pop. It never gets stuck in one spot as it whirls through decades of pop music. What I am trying to say is take a listen and have some fun. I have a feeling you will really really really really really really like it.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>When Chance the Rapper broke out in 2013 behind the critically praised <em>Acid Rap</em> he earned himself a major platform to do exactly what it is he wanted to do. Instead of labeling up and taking the big time advance to release mixtape after mixtape Chicago's favorite son decided to use this outlet on projects that support his ambitious and creative process. One of these outlets is the fantastic <em>Surf.</em><p>
            
<p>Donnie Trumpet &amp; The Social Experiment are a self-proclaimed collective of bohemian musicians and consists of Donnie himself, Chance and numerous other Chicago musicians. Hearing a group with the name experiment talking about being a collective means you are going to get a ton of ideas and that is what we get in <em>Surf</em>. Trying to map out the featured vocalists and musicians on this album is a fairly monumental task. Alongside hip-hop stalwarts J Cole, Busta Rhymes, and Erykah Badu you have artists like Big Sean and names hardly known outside of Chicago.</p>
            
<p>None of this comes off as superficially or muddy though. Anytime you hear a member discuss this album they mention family and how fun and creative the album was. Chance has been running through a "Family Matters" tour where the Social Experiment is his backing band and this structure of family was mentioned numerous times. The songs dance around throughout the album, but that is what makes it fun and a true experiment. It doesn't take itself too seriously.</p>
            
<p>The glue that keeps all these artists together is the musicianship and production. Overall the album is grounded in soul ranging from 60's to the early naughts, but also touches on disco, 80's funk, and  70's easy listening. Despite the long list of vocalists it isn't really a rap album at all. The unique instrumentation is center stage while the MCs verses add in on the fun.</p>
            
<p>I would be remiss not to mention lead single "Sunday Candy." The track features a giddy Chance rapping over the Social Experiment at their best. The video consists of a full-fledged stage production that unfolds in front of you in a single take. Colorful sets, backup dancers, the whole deal. It is also visual proof that the family works hard and has fun doing it.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Muse: Drones</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>It speaks to the pretentiousness and grandiosity of Matt Bellamy when he mentions that the bands 7th studio album <em>Drones</em> would be their chance to "reconnect and remind ourselves of just the basics of who we are," only to drop a gargantuan concept album about human drones in the literal sense as well as a metaphorical representation of the lack of empathy in the modern world. Yeah, exactly, it's a mouthful, but what aspect of Muse hasn't been?<p>
            
<p>In a time where there are very few true, full-fledged rockstars left in music it is encouraging to continue to see Bellamy and Co. crank up the volume to 11, ramp up the production, and craft songs for the soul purpose of playing them in arenas around the world. I don't listen to Muse the way I listen to a lot of other music, you don't listen to Muse for lyrical deepness, we all listen to Muse to rock the eff out and air guitar to Bellamy's brilliance.<p>
            
<p>With <em>The Resistance</em> and <em>The 2nd Law</em> Muse got drowned in their own ambition and released two lackluster albums that drudged in their bold attempt at electro-symphonic bliss.  Let's not speak too poorly on <em>The 2nd Law</em> though, because "Madness" might be the best song that has ever been written in the history of all time.</p>
            
<p>What Muse meant when they mused on (Sorry: had to do it) about returning to their roots is dropping the dub, the orchestra, the nonsense and picking back up the guitar, bass, and drum kit. That decision is what makes this album so fun and so full of rock you will think nothing of the awful lyrics and political conquest that lies within. Lead single "Psyhco" packs a Zeppelin-esque riff that the crew has been playing during interludes live for years.  It marches on with a purpose and never lets go. "Reapers" continues the bluesy heavy metal with a thesis on guitar rock put on from Bellamy starting at the 2:40 mark.<p>
            
<p>The overblown theatrics of Queen are not entirely forgotten on "Revolt" and "The Globalist." One of the reasons I love "Madness" so damn much is that after the quick and powerful guitar solo the song morphs into an all-time bridge that Muse does better than anyone else. Opener "Dead Inside" features on of those bridges that harkens back to <em>Absolution</em> and adds in the synth-pop of Depeche Mode. "The Handler" is absolute classic Muse and what I have wanted to hear from them for years: dirty, Black Sabbath riffs, with Bellamy hitting the falsetto.<p>
            
<p>Bottom line is everyone should turn it to 11, grab that plug in baby and crucify your enemies.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Kendrick Lamar: To Pimp a Butterfly</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>I was almost tempted to keep this album off of my list because I simply could not wrap my head around trying to consume all of it and understand how it can be boiled down into a few paragraphs. An album as critically acclaimed as this has been dissected through all corners of the media and the internet and browsing through them made me realize other people were as lost as I am.</p>
            
<p>Kendrick was at an all-time high after the release of <em>good kid, m.A.A.d city</em> and instead of capitalizing on that and releasing an album full of hooks, guest spots, and viral videos he chose to have us listen in on a 79 minute therapy session. Gone are the easy hooks. Songs get interrupted with arguments and careen out of control. Hip-hop structures have been replaced with a psychedelic onslaught of jazz, soul, and funk. The comfortable feeling of a capable single has to be precisely extracted from the sprawling story. How does today's single-hungry listener experience a 79-minute album that makes you feel uncomfortable at every turn?</p>
            
<p><em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> is a dense and important album and one that touches on so many of the subjects that have made 2015 an uncomfortable year. Kendrick is both petrified by his isolation at the top and inspired by the freedom that it gives him. While the obvious theme of the record is to urge black Americans to rise above racism there is a lot more to it. Faith in god, depression battles, adoration for his country, and self-loathing spiral around stunning musical experiments that seem to have no boundary.</p>
            
<p>I struggled to understand the renowned adoration for something this unstructured and difficult to consume. Was every media outlet praising this album because it came from a prominent black voice in a crucial time in America? Has anyone truly listened to it all the way through? Not because it isn't good, but because it simply is difficult to do.</p>
            
<p>The reason it lands on this list is because it displays to me the ability of a major superstar to completely understand his platform, but not cater to a single expectation of what it means to have the title. It is an artist experimenting with his medium and seeing what the consumer can handle.</p>
            
<p>What it does the most for me is it highlights a possible path for which albums can be consumed in today's landscape. Seeing this album top many year lists and earning an album of the year Grammy nomination makes me want to poll people and ask them how many times they have listened to it full through. 1-5? 10-20? I certainly haven't been able to take it in 20 times. Maybe albums with these types of messages and these ambitions are maybe meant to be consumed like a movie. A handful of times a year you sit down and give your full attention for an hour. This album goes through acts, forces you to think, takes ambitious turns, like any good movie will do. It doesn't quite make sense to break the movie into 16 segments, but like any movie when you come across an incredible scene you take notice and carry that with you. All those experiences are present in this album. That's how I view this album and it makes me more excited to see what else can happen when artists like Kendrick choose to speak and share with us our creativity.</p>
            
<p>I do hope some part of that made sense.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">MUTEMATH: Vitals</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>MUTEMATH has never been a band to settle for too long. They lie among so many various musical fault lines that they never quite coalesce into a particular style or scene long enough to get them too much attention. Grammy nominations or not, they are somewhat of an outsider to their alt-rock contemporaries and <em>Vitals</em> sees the New Orleans Quartet shapeshifting once again.</p>
            
<p>MUTHEMATHs trajectory began with math-rock takes on radio-ready anthems and saw it morph into the bluesy, garage rock of 2010's <em>Odd Soul</em> On Vitals MUTEMATH have opted for a more synth driven, electro-pop centered around their trademarked experimentation and the result is their most infectious album to date.</p>
            
<p>The common thread that has allowed the band to stay on track during their numerous wanderings is that the songs are tactfully constructed and always have an ear towards pop. Everything is excellently poised, controlled, and never overdone. The opening trio of songs displays a tour-de-force of MUTEMATH's fresh take on synth pop.  "Light Up" delivers a chorus with a wobbly bass and synthetic snare that effortlessly transitions into shimmering synths and handclaps. Lead single "Monument" has upbeat drums contrasted against a diving guitar riff.</p>
            
<p>From here the band mixes up the pace of the album and dips into the experimentation and rhythms that longtime fans have grown to love. No MUTEMATH album would be complete without an instrumental or two that allow exceptional drummer Darren King to shine. MUTEMATH are renowned for their infinitely creative and memorable live shows. If you have attended any you will be transfixed at the immense talent of King. In the forefront or background King is always the rhythmic backbone of anything MUTEMATH does. Vitals finds him tactfully alongside the rest of his band members and masked in electronics, but on "Vitals" and "Bulletproof" we see his true meaning to the band represented. "Vitals" plays out as King guiding along the newly incorporated synthesizers into their shining moment and "Bulletproof" kicks the student aside and takes over.</p>
            
<p>If you are looking for a perfect blend on everything that is and has made MUTEMATH great than "Used To" hits all the marks. They have taken the bluesy soul of Odd Soul and glitchy rock of their debut and blended it into a wall of wobbly electronics that results in a finely crafted pop gem.</p>
            
<p>Overall, Vitals carries a celebratory tone of hope and promise. "Hope is vital. It happens from finding a way to believe something great still lies ahead." These words are shared by lead singer Dan Meany and are carried on in the stunning closer "Remain:" "Just keep on trying. Just keep fighting. Just keep going. Just keep surviving. Just keep walking. Just keep breathing. Just keep holding. Just keep believing."</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>It has been quite the last few years for Tobias Jesso Jr. In the middle of 2012, after muddling around Los Angeles trying to make a career as a pop ghostwriter and recently going through a breakup, Jesso Jr. was blindsided by a car and sent flying off his bicycle. After gathering his senses and seeing blood on his hands and face Jesso Jr. got up in time to see a stranger riding off with his bike. Then, on the very next day after leaving the hospital and wondering if his hand would ever be able to play guitar again he called his mom to find out she had been diagnosed with cancer. Not waiting to see what other sign would be thrown his way he stuck his instruments in storage and moved back to Vancouver to spend time with his family.</p>
            
<p>While there, Jesso started playing his sisters piano for the first time and began to make music that was truly for him. After uploading his music to YouTube and emailing a few of his industry friends things started looking up. Fast forward to the present and Jesso finds himself on the heels of a perfectly crafted debut album, back in LA hanging with the likes of the HAIM sisters and Dan Auerbach, giving lessons to eager listeners at SXSW, and earning a co-writer credit on the second single of the biggest album in decades (Adele's "When We Were Young").</p>
            
<p><em>Goon</em> is Jesso Jr's redemption story. A collection of classic-sounding tunes that detail all aspects of his journey and the triumph of getting through it. "Hollywood" is Jesso reliving the memory. The songs long pauses add to the desolation, but are also there so that Jesso can reach the chords with his messed up hand. Album favorite "Can't stop thinking about you" is as simple as a piano melody gets, but it strikes home with confidence and speaks of the yearning for a lost love without any of the other audacious or over dramatization that comes from other breakup albums.</p>
            
<p>When I first heard these songs it was as though I had been listening to them for years and years. The easy melodies and uncomplicated lyrics brought about a sense of security and recalled the height of the 60s-70s best piano powerhouses. There are glaring hints of Randy Newman, Solo McCartney, and solo Lennon over the sparse orchestration and it is done absolutely beautifully. The difference between those guys and Jesso is that they were pure, trained piano players. And Jesso will probably get there, but to listen to such a classic sound that is raw and capable of breaking down at any point is a very powerful thing.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>I guess to place to start with The Dear Hunter is that it started as a musical outlet for the brilliant and ambitious mind of Casey Crescenzo as he sought a place for songs that didn't fit his main gig as a core member of The Receiving End of Sirens. To say that The Dear Hunter took on a life of its own is an understatement. High school me was sad to see Crescenzo leave TREOS since <em>Between the Heart and the Synapse</em> was one of the best albums to come out of the scene. But in the nine years since, The Dear Hunter has made some of the most interesting, audacious, and fun music out there and have become mainstays in the grand and sweeping category of prog-rock along the likes of The Mars Volta and Coheed and Cambria.</p>
            
<p>As you might have guessed, <em>Act IV: Rebirth in Reprise</em> is the fourth release of a planned six and the first in six years. Don't think for a second Crescenzo has been sitting around for six years though.  He released a 9 EP set called The Color Spectrum in which he crafted a musical representative of each color of the visible spectrum (extremely ambitious, probably pretentious, but also extremely interesting and good) and a straight forward album that didn't fit the themes or narrative of the Acts.</p>
            
<p>The Acts are the convoluted story of a boy who comes of age in the early years of the 20th century. Knowing all the details is not at all necessary to enjoy the album, but if you want to take a deep dive there are plenty of websites out there that will be of assistance. What makes this album so good is that it is an album! In an age of singles, it gives me joy to listen to a story unfold over the course of 15 songs. It is highly theatrical, dense, heartfelt, and refreshing.</p>
            
<p>As The Dear Hunter is apt to do it takes various genres like indie, pop, prog, folk, and chamber and lets them stand on their own or blends them together. This idea is nothing new to The Dear Hunter, but in this album it is done with force and confidence. Crescenzo hired the Bay Area Awesome Orchestra to help bring out his many ideas. This takes the remarkable production to a whole new level and makes it even more theatrical and dramatic (horns, string, choir, everything!).</p>
            
<p>So dive in and listen to a song or two, but if you got the time I would listen to this behemoth straight through at least once and get the full experience.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Looking at the cover of Lord Huron's Strange Trails brings to mind the type of dollar adventure novel that you would see collecting dust at a used bookstore. The scene is washed in sepia and moss is growing on the trees. There is a retro sense of Americana and storytelling.</p>
            
<p>This aesthetic is not lost on the sprawling adventure that is <em>Strange Trails.</em> Through the lonesome twang of singer Ben Schneider we are swept off into a Western adventure full of trails and troubadours backed by a perfect collage of Americana and ensemble folk. "That's the way I kind of envisioned it: There are all these separate tales from this world," Schneider says. "But they overlap and they tangle. And they collide sometimes."</p>
            
<p>Debut album <em>Lonesome Dreams</em> found Schneider hitting all the prerequisites garnered by the likes of Phosphorescent's, Fleet Foxes', and My Morning Jacket's brand of folk Americana. With Strange Trails the basics have been perfected and the arrangements perfected. The production is beefed up, instrumentation fleshed out, and reverb soaked around a confident Schneider, who is more than willing to take the reins.</p>
            
<p>Though the narrators change, our adventure repeatedly discuss the end of the world. "Until the Night Turns" finds greaser Johnny narrating the party for the end of the world. "We wait for the sunrise. We watch as the world dies. We howl in the moonlight. When the World Ender comes, baby don't close your eyes." The artwork for "The World Ender" depicts a comic book drawn skeleton donned in a leather jacket. A stirring and toe-tapping rhythm backs our narrator as he proclaims that "The fair and the brave and the good must die, I seen the other side of living, I know heaven's a lie, I'll tear through the night, and I'll raise some hell, cause I'm the World Ender, baby and I'm back from the dead."</p>
            
<p>Schneider and crew brilliantly pace each adventure with melodic hooks and stylistic variance that set them apart from the contemporaries and into the lush world they have created. At 14 tracks and almost an hour <em>Strange Trails</em> is sprawling and requires work, but taken a chapter at a time there is depth to the stories scope and ambition. What epic Western have you gotten through that hasn't ultimately rewarded you for your investment? <em>Strange Trails.</em> is no different.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Mew: +-</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Danish quartet Mew have never quite been on our same plane of existence. Their atmospheric, prog-rock anthems have lifted up listeners for almost 20 years now. By looking at the guys they haven't aged a single day either, so whatever plane they are on they are neighbors with roommates John Stamos and Rob Lowe.</p>
            
<p>I first started listening to Mew early high school when I was blown away by <em>Frengers'</em> "Am I Wry? No" and over that decade or so I have always been encapsulated by the bands ambition and the mystique of singer Jonas Bjerre's voice. Bjerre's ethereal falsetto features delicate and airy notes that lie on top Mew's brand of melodic art-rock. Despite the ever-morphing band dipping into all aspects of guitar driven prog-rock, from sprawling shoegaze efforts to crashing guitar riffs, Bjerre maintains complete control of the songs by delicately holding onto them and guiding them into uncharted territories only Mew know the location of.</p>
            
<p>After a six-year hiatus Mew have found themselves transformed once again into a more streamlined, confident, and polished version of themselves. <em>+-</em>  is Mew at their grandest, mixing rolling anthems and cosmic pop into a perfect amalgamation of their past to craft a story of what makes them great. Nothing proclaims this effort more than in lead single "Satellites." Appregiated guitars lift into dramatic percussion before marching into a maybe the best chorus of the band's career. Bjerre is as confident as ever as the subtle percussion plays off of rolling guitar.</p>
            
<p>There is a sense of celebration on the album as well as Mew find themselves spreading around the vocal duties more than ever. "Interview the Girls" interlocks vocal chants perfectly. Kimbra appears in "The Night Believer" as she duets with Bjerre and their voices melt into each other over a dreamscape that Mew has perfected. The spacey aggrandizing intro of "My Complications" is rapidly shifted into melancholic urgency with Russell Lissack of Bloc Party's trademark guitar work.</p>
            
<p>The albums closing tracks "Rows" and "Cross the River on Your Own," clocking in at seven and eleven minutes respectively, shine a spotlight on the sprawling vision that has made Mew stand above peers over the years. The latter begins with Bjerre whispering over a subtle atmosphere and simple guitar. As the track progress more and more instruments join the fray in dramatic fashion to flesh out the landscape. It is an ode to the emotional drive of Mew's past, an undulating frequency of contained and forceful segments. "Rows" is epic in scope and its orchestral nature turns anthem rock on its back. A quiet beginning builds into an overwhelming powerhouse of distortion and sound and from there emerges a hectic and almost danceable ending segment. I finally got to see Mew live for the first time this summer and witnessing "Rows" was one of the most memorable moments I have ever experienced in live music.</p>
            
<p>"It took two decades as a band, but Bjerre and company, intentionally or not, finally composed their answer to Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here." The sound of thunder that Mew displays on <em>+-</em> may be a delicate one, but it's not less profound because of it." -NPR Music</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>When you listen to a band either on your headphones or at a show there are moments where you feel the band being completely locked into their sound and each other. These moments are what make the music listening experience so enjoyable.  <em>All Your Favorite Bands</em> reads as a band completely in step with what makes them great. Recorded live in studio, the soothing harmonies, rootsy rhythms, and clean cut guitars swirl around and play off each other with the precision.</p>
            
<p>Album centerpiece "I Can't Think About It Now" is classic Dawes and truly defines where this band is with each other and their sound. It is a six minute song that screams California folk rock. The drums and piano march the song through various tempos. At the 2:30 mark the band takes you on an instrumental interlude that you can close your eyes and just take in what makes rock music and Americana great. At the 5:15 mark the band snaps you out of the trance and has a moment in which singer Taylor Goldsmith picks up the pace and finishes the song off with urgency. It is a truly beautiful thing to listen to.</p>
            
<p>Lyrically the album takes you through the trials and tribulations of a breakup. Goldsmith plays well with the emotional duality and dishes out equal amounts of bitterness, self-doubt, happiness, and reflection. The delivery and choice of words make it believable and it plays in perfectly to the style of the music. Only Dawes can get away with starting a song off talking about hot French fries. The title track features a reflection on an old friend and Goldsmith delivers the line "I hope the world sees the same person that you've always been to me and may all your favorite bands stay together." It's a beautiful line about growing up and taking time to reflect on the people in your life.</p>

            <p>In the age and musical landscape that we find ourselves in today there are countless instances of bands launching themselves into the spotlight. Be it striking gold with a catchy single, being thrust forward by corporate backing, or catching on to the latest trends it can always come as a risk. Sometimes it works great and those artists genuinely have the chops the keep it together after their tide turns. Sometimes it doesn't and we see artists fade after the collective public gets over their single, or sometimes their live shows never coalesce into something special. Making your debut comes at a risk and getting clear perspective of the hype train is a lost art. Sometimes taking your time works out in the end.</p>
            
<p>I say all of this to bring up the case of Wolf Alice. Being that they are bred from London, the four-piece seemed to have come from nowhere on our side of the pond, but that is far from the case. Over the course of the last five years the band started from an acoustic folk duo, picked up a rhythm section, and made their rounds touring and figuring themselves out. Over those years various EPs were released and their buzz only grew and grew. As the young quartet matured, did their homework, and honed in on what it is that makes them great they released one of the best debuts in recent memory.</p>
            
<p>True to their name, Wolf Alice have lured us all in with <em>My Love is Cool</em> With the nod to the past and refreshing eye to the present Wolf Alice have graced us with a musical ambush that twists and turns at every corner and typifies what makes innovative debuts such a joy. This album just screams joy. It is a rollercoaster and at every instance feels completely in the now and refreshing. Sometimes it's nice to get wrapped up in your headphones and run around the street, or enjoy hanging out with your friends, or strut around with confidence.</p>
            
<p>Opener "Turn to Dust" is a light, folky number filled with increasingly eerie background as singer Ellie Roswell invites the audience to "keep your beady eyes on me." It truly is the Wolf luring Alice into the forest. From there the band takes us on a journey to prove that guitar music isn't dead and Wolf Alice will not be pigeonholed. "Swallowtail" is a dreamy atmospheric gem that breaks out into full blown My Bloody Valentine in the last 20 seconds. "Giant Peach" features a pure and fierce guitar breakdown likely to be seen on early Muse records. The numerous grunge moments and having a female singer will undoubtedly bring out comparisons to Hole, but this isn't a bad thing. "Moaning Lisa Smile" channels Courtney Love, but good. "You're a germ" features Roswell breaking down with the fury of The Pixies.</p>
            
<p>You will have to listen yourself to experience the many other turns in this record. One of my favorite moments is in the summery "Freazy" where Roswells sings: Did you really wanna...with Alice?/ Did you really wanna...with the wolf?/ You can hate us all you want but/It don't mean nothing at all. The omission of the expletive compounded with an actual pause in the music is a brilliant move. It delivery speaks of a band who doesn't take themselves too seriously and is enjoying having fun. <em>My Love is Cool</em> is simply fun. At such a young age the band is mature, knows its history, and makes music that keeps you guessing and most importantly, makes rock music fun.

            <h4 class="modal-title">Jamie XX: In Colour</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Jamie Smith, aka Jamie XX, has never been one to shy away from expressing his influences. At only 27 years old Smith was way too young to experience the 90's London rave scene, but it quickly became an obsession of his. Listen to any of his curated sets on the likes of BBC Radio One or Apple Music and you will see him paying homage to the era over and over again.</p>
            
<p>As a kid spending his youth in the YouTube age Smith was able to experience the rave scene in a way that was not available to those living during it. Smith pieced together the decade by splicing up videos, consuming at all hours of the day, and setting his research to the perfect soundtrack. <em>In Colour</em> is a beautiful kaleidoscope ride through a seminal period of artistic outburst curated by an artist bent on tapping in to genres past to help push them forward.</p>
            
<p>The mystique of minimalism that has come to define Smith through his work with day job The XX continues on In Colour. When at times The XX's minimalism felt too claustrophobic <em>In Colour</em> takes another approach and uses the art form as a means to find space and move around.  This approach allows Smith to strip out all the unnecessary sounds, create his space, and dial up the impact when necessary.</p>
            
<p>The collage of sound, lyrical content, and the genius stroke of adding in inaudible chatter between songs drives Smith's goal of taking the listeners through a night clubbing in London. "Wanna change your colours, just for the night?" is whispered by bandmate Oliver Sim on the sparse "Stranger in a Room." It beckons the liberating euphoria of a night raving and is gone before you even realized it was there. "Loud places" finds Romy in a club proclaiming "I go to loud places to search for someone/to be quiet with/who will take me home." It is with this line that Jamie begins maybe the best stretch of music all year.</p>
            
<p>The run of Loud Places to closer Girl is what makes graceful dance music and the album format so great. There is euphoria in the chorus of "Loud Places" and as the dancehall fades out into a whisper the breakout hit "I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)" comes into play. The track samples the Persuasions in a reggaeton tradeoff between Popcaan and Young Thug as Smith's patent steel drums accent the mix. Moving on to "The Rest is Noise" we find Smith making his declaration as one of the best in the game. The subtleties on this track jump out more than any other place on the album. Hearing the pianos dance over a racing heartbeat only to be scattered into pieces as the track drops through the floor is mastery at work. "Girl" closes out the record as an ode to his predecessors by slowly introducing new sounds and repeating them only to see them melt away as Jamie ends our journey and makes the long walk home after a night out.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>When you follow an artist for over a decade's time you develop a certain comfort when you hear their voice. Dustin Kensrue is one of my favorite songwriters of all time (See Butch Walker review for more details) and there isn't a voice in music that takes me back to so many good memories and experiences. Thrice (he is their front man if you didn't know) are the band that got me interested in music as a hobby and something I truly loved experiencing and exploring. As Thrice continually evolved their sound and kept pushing the envelope I found myself venturing into new territories as well. While my taste's today vary widely from what they were in say 2003, I owe a lot of the willingness to explore all types of music to Thrice.</p>
            
<p>As a solo artist <em>Carry the Fire</em> is Kensrue's third full length effort and widely different from the first two. 2007's <em>Please</em> Come Home is a <em>Nebraska</em> inspired folk record and 2013's <em>The Water &amp; the Blood</em> was a straightforward worship album. I won't get too much into the circumstances surrounding this period in Kensrue's life, basically it took place during a time he moved his family, put Thrice on hiatus, and became a pastor at a controversial church. Regardless, it featured some of his best vocal work to date. Lyrically Kensrue has always dabbled with various levels of spirituality in his lyrics, either straightforward or veiled in metaphors. After over 11 albums collectively, <em>Carry the Fire</em> finds Kensrue at the perfect sweet spot in his career on both a musical and vocal level. After emerging from an interesting point in his life he delivers an album full of hope, love, perseverance, and fortitude. Many of those same things can be found in the religion he studies, but here they are unmasked and applicable to his daily life.</p>
            
<p>"Ruby" sets the tone with piano driven pop and serves as an open love note to his wife. This song serves as the perfect opener because it unveils the attitude of the album. These songs are going to be easy to digest, a joy to listen to, and will express hope throughout. The honesty of the album and mix of musical styles truly speak to Kensrue's mindset of having a good time and sharing to the world his current state of mind: The band is back together, his family is healthy, and he is back home!</p>
            
<p>"Back to Back" channels Kensrue's signature rasp and discusses the difficulties and joy that come with marriage:   There's no one I'd rather walk with/ Through the brier or the flame/Let me hold you in the darkness/ In the fire, in the rain. Fighting to maintain that partner is a necessity in the moments discussed in highway rumbler "In the Darkness." A fast paced, urgent song about facing the abyss and having someone there by your side.</p>
            
<p>Kensrue also slows it down in multiple places. "There's Something Dark" finds Kensure crooning about the dark frailty that is in all of us. "What Beautiful Things" starts out acoustically and boils into a passionate shout about the beautiful things in life. The delicate, piano-driven ballad of "Of Crows and Crowns" is Kensure at his romantic and hopeful self. A poem full of life and love.</p>
            
<p>The sounds of Thrice find themselves sprinkled throughout. Most notably in the title track closer, which is borrowed from the writings of Cormac McCarthy.  "Carry the Fire" has pulsating dynamics, an increasing build, and powerful vocals that are found in some of Thrice's best moments. Overall, Carry the Fire finds Kensrue sending us through a whirlwind of his favorite sounds and eras in his musical career. Never has he sounded more comfortable and more at peace with his place in the world. It is a beautiful thing to listen to.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">The World is a Beautiful Place &amp; I am No Longer Afraid to Die: Harmlessness</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Connecticut's The World is a Beautiful Place and I am No Longer Afraid to Die, in their current state, is a group of nine musicians who are hard to pin down. They have turned over members numerous times in five years, decided to release forks with download links inscribed, made a spoken word EP, and oh yeah, released the gold standard for what an emo record in the 2010's should sound like with 2013's <em>Whenever, If Ever.</em> With more eyes on them and a backing from Epitaph Records TWIABP gave the world Harmlessness and the result is an hour long dense, complex, and enlightening journey that never grows weary or tired, but constantly moves forward with grace and momentum.</p>
            
<p>For <em>Harmlessness</em> TWIABP have chosen to take on a more sweeping post-rock, indie, and sometimes punk sound. Each of the songs build, crash, sweep over you, and invoke emotion with the ambition. Hearing that line and seeing that there are nine members in the band will immediately invoke Arcade Fire and there is some influence here. What sets them apart is the sincerity of this approach. Each build up is calculated and doesn't simply happen for the pretentiousness of knowing they can. <em>Harmlessness</em> is musical theater inviting you in for the dramatic, telling you stories, and leaving you with important questions.</p>
            
<p>A shape-shifting and dense album like this is tough to dissect without churning out a term paper on all the nuances and brilliances found within. That being said, a substantial amount of attention must be paid to lead single "January 10th, 2014." Hearing this song before the release of the full album was one of those "You have got to be kidding me moments." The song is a 5:30 minute audacious and beautiful song that packs a dense subject matter over a precise up and down journey. It is that moment of a band coming together and making a statement.</p>
            
<p>"January 10th, 2014" details the true life story of "Diana, the Hunter," the anonymous girl from Juarez, Mexico, who shot and killed two factory bus drivers as revenge for the epidemic of unprosecuted sexual assault committed by drivers on late-night routes. After, she became a folk hero and was even honored with statues in two cities. This story unfolds through the shifting perspective of each character as voiced by singers David Bello and Katie Shanholtzer-Dvorak. Midway through we see the impact of Diana in the empowered women through a vocal exchange of a weary bus driver who suspects his driver might just be Diana: "Are you afraid of me now?" she sings. "Well yeah," he responds, "Shouldn't I be?" Diana speaks for all women: But don't you quiver / I am an instrument / I am revenge / I am several women.</p>
            
<p>Not only do the characters manage to tell the story, but they also confront the audience with the uncomfortable dilemma about whether taking a life out of revenge is ever justified. While sympathizing with Diana the nasty irony of celebrating murder is not lost on anyone. All of this unfolds as the band sounds as on point and confident as they have ever been. The music dances through genres and rushes you through the magnitude of the story.</p>
            
<p>The rest of the album touches on many other subjects as the music continually surprises and leaves it mark. Opener "You can't live there Forever" channels Neutral Milk Hotel as it begins with an acoustic lo-fi performance and builds into a swelling string arrangement that asks us how we think the world is alright given that there is so much more that requires our attention. The last minute of "Haircuts for Everybody" builds into a powerful crescendo as the vocals join together and urge the subjects to change their lives and overcome this depression.</p>
            
<p>I can go on forever pinpointing the moments. "Rage Against The Dying Of The Light" and "Ra Patera Dance" are as much of a cathartic one-two as you will listen to this year. "The Word Lisa" is perfect pop. I won't even begin to break into the 20 minute runtime of album closers "I Can Be Afraid of anything" and "Mount Hum." Those two tracks are behemoths of their own and demand attention.  If I have meandered in this review I apologize, but Harmlessness is a record the invites you to meander. TWIABP are at the top of their craft and have released an album that stands alone on its own.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Josh Ritter: Sermon on the Rocks</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Josh Ritter is a word man. "He's like a rapper with his word count. And he can use that many words in a verse and have it sound cool, and not just irritating." This unique talent is what makes Ritter such a damn good songwriter. The words are jam packed, but for good reasons, and it leads into fresh and interesting melodies. Combine that with his encompassing discography and the man rounds out my favorite songwriters of all time. For those that have been reading and counting that makes the top 5: Andrew McMahon, Dustin Kensrue, Ryan Adams, Butch Walker, and Josh Ritter. OK, sidetrack over, I will take my obsessions with lists somewhere else.</p>
            
<p>Now eight albums in, Ritter has always had plenty to say. On 2013's <em>Beasts in Its Tracks</em> Ritter was reeling from a recent divorce and he channeled his songwriting inward as he wrestled to figure out how to deal with the situation. While a great album and one filled with hope, it was claustrophobic with its heady subject matter. On <em>Sermon on the Rocks</em> Ritter spins the dial in the complete opposite direction. Aiming to create "messianic oracular honky-tonk" Ritter weaves stories about small time life with vivid imagery and a propulsive swagger.</p>
            
<p>The dozen songs on <em>Sermon</em> find Ritter acting as a sort of traveling preacher. A lot of songs deal with biblical imagery in the peppiest and brightest way possible. Single "Getting Ready for the Get Down" is a danceable story that jaunts on about a young girl whose church parents send her to a small college because they fear she may be headed towards a life of sin. The song is jammed packed with rapid fire lines. "When you get damned in the popular opinion / It's just another damn of the damns not given" and "Jesus hates your high school dances" are just a few that can be extracted from the fun.</p>
            
<p>The free flowing and bright nature of the album is helped on by the setting it was created in. Ritter spent time in New Orleans recording the album with The Royal City Band and they are key players in achieving the albums tone. They carry the words with a loose and pulsating tone. This is especially true on album favorites "Homecoming" and "Where the Night Goes." The former is about the excitement of love and coming home. The latter is a loose rocker that speaks of coming home, gathering your friends, and seeing what trouble you can get into. It is delivered with a Dylan-esque barrage of lyrics.</p>
            
<p>Ritter can't help, but diving into some dense subjects either. "Birds of the Meadow" forays into the apocalypse. "Young Moses" draws on religion and finds a young Moses walking away from a religious life to wander about and the bluesy, folksy growl helps deliver the tone. We also have "Seeing Me 'Round" that tells the story of a murder victim following around his murderer in spirit and constantly reminding him that they will cross paths soon. It is an eerie and beautiful song. These songs woven in with the others offer up an unpredictable album. This unpredictability is what makes the songs adventurous, weird, fun, and bottom line a joy to listen to. It is nice to hear Josh having some fun again. </p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Tame Impala: Currents</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Tame Impala exists purely in the mind of Kevin Parker down to every note in each song and every light in each live performance. After two critically acclaimed albums and rise to festival stardom Tame Impala could have easily rested on their psych-rock, guitar-driven talent, but that was simply not going to be the case. As the opening notes of album opener "Let it Happen" envelope you, Parker unveils the future and sweeps you up into a world of change.  At about the halfway mark the song seems to kick into gear and catch you off guard. The track clicks and repeats itself and before you can question it you quickly realize that it's a brilliantly crafted segue into the pulsating and propulsive second act. The song sprawls over a psych-rock disco and is easily Parker's most production-heavy piece. As the track alternates between styles, volumes, and focus points it features a meticulous obsession that has become trademark Parker. "Let it happen" is about "Finding yourself always in this world of chaos...always shutting it out because you don't want to be part of it. But at some point, you realize it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'."</p>
            
<p>The song also serves as words of comfort to just trust Parker and accept this change. <em>Currents</em> finds Parker ushering us into a world of change washed over with synths and disco beats. While less guitar driven, the trademark phasing effects, echoing vocals, and other prog touches make for an album that remains psychedelic as ever. It is dance music for closed eyes and slow grooves.</p>
            
<p>One of the most interesting elements of the album is its pop focus. Parker worked closely with Mark Ronson on <em>Uptown Special</em> and maybe time spent there has seeped into the consciousness of Tame Impala. The opening of "The Moment" recalls 80's Michael Jackson. Where we might have previously witnessed a guitar wig-out or psychedelic drop, Parker infuses in slick melodies and finger clicks over traditional pop structures that we rarely see from the band.</p>
            
<p>The central focus of change is perfectly encapsulated in "Yes, I'm Changing." The swirling electro ballad is the closest the band will ever get to a diva-style power track. What makes Parkers take on the ballad so interesting is that he shrouds if over a sonic cloud as he lazily delivers the heartbreaking realization that "they say people never change but that's bullshit / They do."</p>
            
<p><em>Currents</em> is an album that finds itself easy to dance to, but at the same time it is a deeply melancholic albums as well. "Eventually" approaches the breakup song from the rare perspective of the person doing the breakup. "And I know just what I've got to do / And it's got to be soon / Cause I know that I'll be happier / And I know you will too." It is a powerful song that features a rare barrage of fuzz before a single finger snap brings you back to the disco. Relationships are just another facet of change that Parker touches on. The difference here is Parker's approach. 2012's <em>Lonerism</em> featured schizophrenic introspection that constantly drew in on itself. <em>Currents</em> reverses that course and approaches many of the same issues with hopeful optimism.</p>

<p>Tame Impala have provided us with a masterpiece of an album that serves best as a sonic tour. There is no apparent beginning and end, just a world you weren't aware you could be carried off into.  Just let it happen and you will quickly realize you are all the better for it.

            <h4 class="modal-title">San Fermin: Jackrabbit</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>San Fermin is a Brooklyn collective born out of the mind of classically trained composer Ellis Ludwig-Leone. As a live outfit they have settled in as an octet that features Ludwig-Leone standing way to the side of the stage on his keyboards as he lets the rest of the crew jump around vocal duties and instruments that include saxophone, trumpet, guitar, drums, violins, and whatever else they can bang on. Seeing Ludwig-Leone on the side of the stage like a director and knowing he is responsible for each and every note is really interesting to watch. He is extremely humble, when the band members mention he writes the music he always has a visual cringe. There is a clear sense of joy in his body language as he gets to hang out with his best friends and watch them enjoy themselves over the music that means so much to him. This kind of composer-performer relationship is nothing new in music, but it is very rare in this branch of the industry and because of that it is extremely refreshing.</p>
            
<p>The driving force of the band is the juxtaposed male and female voices of Allen Tate and Charlene Kaye. It is impossible not to notice Tate is a carbon copy of Matt Berninger of The National, but this does nothing to distract from his performance contrary to what other people might have you believe. His deep, smooth, and rumbling baritone drives the music forward with force, but Kaye offers an angelic and rapturously operatic foil to Tate and makes for many special moments throughout the album.</p>
            
<p>The vocal dynamics on top of highly orchestral music carry you to another dimension. Listening to Ludwig-Leones restless song structuring is indicative of an individual that is simply on a completely different level than the rest of us. Many of the songs start off very classical and traditional but break off into all different directions. There are surreal twilight endings, cacophonous explosions reminiscent of a grand finale, and constantly piercing horns and violin.</p>
            
<p>The back to back of "Emily" and "Jackrabbit" are what makes the DNA of San Fermin so damn good. "Emily" is driven by Tate where his lyrics and the music express his loneliness, despite being among people, and his pursuit of emotional stability. Immediately after, "Jackrabbit" is fronted by Kaye and acts as a kick in the face and direct response to Tate's sentiment. Ludwig-Leone states: "'Jackrabbit' is the last song I wrote on this record, and it definitely sums up some themes I've been circling for a while now. It's fight-or-flight plus a marching band, which is basically my stance on everything." Such a perfect line to encapsulate what San Fermin is all about.</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Sufjan Stevens: Carrie and Lowell</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>For as long as Sufjan Stevens has been making music he has consistently conveyed great emotion. There is a consistent mark of melancholy that is masked in an outsized sense of ambition. For every musing on death or grief we find strings, horns, electronic madness, or a choir to help distract ourselves. This was none more apparent than on 2010's <em>Age of Adz</em> when Stevens masks the pains of "articles of imminent death" with saturated trans-genre maximalism. On <em>Carrie and Lowell</em> all the theatrics are stripped and completely hollowed out by grief. What is left behind is an album as expansive as any other Sufjan effort, but achieved without the ambition and vigor of times past.</p>
            
<p>The album title refers to Stevens' Mother and Stepfather. Carrie left Sufjan and the rest of the family when he was very young. Over the years he got to know his mother over visits to Oregon. She constantly struggled with depression, substance abuse, and schizophrenia. In 2012 she died of cancer and Stevens was around in the months leading up to her death. <em>Carrie and Lowell</em> is the most powerful kind of storytelling.  Steven's pulls you into his own sense emotions to create the link between listener and artist. In the process of detailing the mother-son connection that never was, Stevens faces up to the universals of grief, guilt, anger, questions of faith, and the sense of finality and absence. The result is heartbreaking, powerful, moving, and above all hopeful.</p>
            
<p>Every line in <em>Carrie and Lowell</em> has meaning and is meant to be heard. Instrumentation has been reduced to beautiful melodies of acoustic guitar and piano. The production is so bare you can hear air conditioners in the background and Sufjan exhaling from the weight of emotion. It is a delicacy that completely engrosses the listener as Stevens expresses the words he never had the chance to say. "I forgive you mother, I can hear you and I long to be near you, but every road leads to an end" follows a beautiful piano melody on opener "Death with Dignity." It sounds as if Sufjan is sitting in the corner of the room singing only to himself.</p>
            
<p>Album highlight "Should Have Known Better" might just be my favorite musical moment of 2015. It is a stunning story told in two parts. The first half takes us back to the exact moments Carrie left the kids at a video store. It is sung in a hushed voice that finds Steven's grasping for warmth in the wake of her absence. At the halfway mark an uplifting electric keyboard kicks in and subtle notes of percussion tap into view to remind us to keep going. The vocals form a chorus with themselves to shake off the shadow and bloom into something hopeful. The song discovers a positive perspective. Fear is shoved aside and Sufjan begins to see the beauty of his mother in his daughter-in-law's face. I should have known better / Nothing can be changed / The past is still the past / The bridge to nowhere is sung not with resigned pessimism, but with the easiness that comes from letting go of the past and embracing the present. It is one of those incredible moments that makes listening to music so enjoyable.</p>
            
<p>The album is riddled with honesty and a descriptive wrestling of emotion. In the tender and visceral "Fourth of July" Sufjan imagines a conversation with his mother from the grave that is mostly spoken from her perspective. She apologized for leaving the family, asks him not to cry, and questions if he felt enough love. "Did you get enough love, my little dove / Why do you cry? / And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best / Though it never felt right." The song ends with the eerie repetition of "We're all gonna die." On album closer "Blue Bucket of Gold" Sufjan takes us back to the most basic themes of human life: the desire to be loved and our own mortality. "Tell me you want me in your life, or raise your red flag, just as I want you in my life."</p>
            
<p>What really set this album apart from any others this year was witnessing it in a live setting. At the Copley Symphony Hall in San Diego I had the chance to see Sufjan for the first time. What followed was two hours of one of the most cathartic and moving experiences in my entire life. Joined by a full band Stevens went through the entirety of the album without saying a word and letting the music speak for itself. Every song was reworked to reach new heights with the band backing and added in features of past Sufjan music to make it an entirely new experience. At the halfway mark, before launching into some fan favorites, Sufjan spoke to the crowd with an honesty of two friends talking to each other. Interlaced with stories about his mother he thanked us for letting him be there and letting him express this period of his life through the music. The final song of the night featured a ten minute version of "Blue Bucket of Gold" that was utterly stunning and beautiful. At the end Sufjan simply said "I love you" to the crowd and never before have I heard those words delivered with such honesty and meaning.</p>
            
<p>Listening to an album with such a backstory, so much emotion, and so much room to explore is what makes diving into good music so rewarding. Couple that with a tremendous live performance that presents the music in an entirely different light and you have just a small glimpse into what makes music so special to me and such a joy to spend time with and consume.</p>
