          <h4>Our lives revolve around music. We relate to it, we react to it, we sing to it. We may not always see its importance, but it is always in our presence. If not heard, it is thought about, if not important to us, it carries us through every step of the way. That is the beauty of music, no one can ever take it away. Take advantage of free advice from a song writer, retrieve emotions, and know that this melody can never hurt you. -Anonymous

          <p id="25-21">I pulled up these reviews from the old Coachella Blog and put them over here. 2014 was a diverse year in music for me. The highlight coming in the form of seeing about 20 artists while traveling throughout Iceland. This list features the return of some favorites as well as some ventures into territories I haven't spent much time in.

            <p>This is not the first time in these posts you will see Iceland involved in some way shape or form. The Icelandic music scene was a big reason I got interested in the country in the first place. After all, I found out it was a country when I started listening to Sigur Ros. So when I asked my snorkeling instructor to name me an Icelandic band he was super into the moment he said Kaleo without hesitation. With that advice I went to the record store back in the city and bought their self-titled album without hearing a single note.</p>
            
<p>And let me say it did not disappoint. This album is pure rock and roll fun. There are the absolute in your face tracks like 'Glass House' and 'Rock N Roller' to the wind-in-your-face 'Automobile' and the bluesy 'Pour Sugar on Me.' If it were not for their cover of an Icelandic song ‘Vor I Vaglaskogi,’ Iceland’s most played song in 2013, it would be hard to believe this band came from there. Especially given their lyrics mention Texas, San Diego, and San Francisco and their clear influences are American artists like Kings of Leon and The Black Keys. Wherever they may be from, they are rocking it, and cross our fingers they make their way to America soon.</p>

            <p>Dan Snaith, aka Caribou, has an amazing ability to take intricate and complex songs and make them damn near irresistible and mesmerizing. Snaith has a PhD in Math and it clearly shows. He takes dozens of variables and mixes them around into a simple solution. A song like the title track perfectly combines mellow vocals, snappy strings, big house snares, and frenzied bass drops. You can break it apart if you want and adore the details or you can sit back and let it take you for a ride. This is one of those albums that you can get lost into. Equally satisfying if you are lounging around or if you are doing other, you know, electronic music things.  </p>

            <p>Alright follow closely. Sisyphus is a collaboration between Sufjan Stevens, Son Lux, and Serengeti that was commissioned by the Walker Art Center and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra's <em>Liquid Music</em> series to accompany an exhibition of the work of visual artist Jim Hodges. It "is almost certainly the greatest hip-hop folk-tinged electronica with a deep techno pop groove record you'll ever hear." Still with me?</p>
            
<p>The crazy part about this project is that it works and it is really fun. I can't speak to Serengeti but all the things that make Sufjan and Son Lux great are in this album. Serengeti's lyrics are often silly, but fun. Every Sufjan vocal moment on this album is fantastic and just upsets me more that Sufjan hasn't made a proper album in years. The Son Lux production is top notch, quirky, and adventurous. A song like 'Rhythm of Devotion' perfectly encapsulates each collaborator. Again, don't tell me you can listen to 'Rhythm of Devotion' and not beg for a new Sufjan album? His appearances here are just magic.

            <p>Jenny Lewis is a very prolific songwriter, having released albums under Rilo Kiley, Jenny and Johnny, Jenny Lewis and the Watson Twins, and now solo as just Jenny Lewis. There is plenty of good stuff to go through, but personally I was never fully in on her music until <em>The Voyager</em> was released this year. Produced by Ryan Adams (don't worry you will hear more from him later in this list) the songs jump around from style to style, but remain extremely California. Her lyrics are sharp and dark, touching on many different themes, but the bright instrumentals and catchy as all hell melodies make the songs easy to digest.</p>

<p>I read an article about The 5 best Tom Petty albums of 2014, meaning albums that are clearly influenced by Tom Petty, and this album as well as two others made my list. Maybe this is stemming from the Ryan Adams production (his album has Petty all over it). 'You Can't Outrun em' is classic Petty and 'She's Not Me' is so Ryan Adams as well as Tom Petty that Adams has been covering it recently on tour probably confusing the hell out of his audience. If this is the Jenny Lewis we are going to see from now on then I am all in</p>
            
<p>Live Review:  I just recently saw Jenny Lewis perform on December 15th opening for, who else, Ryan Adams at the Copley Symphony Hall and she was awesome. Being all of 5' 1" she has so much swagger and is way cooler then I will ever be. Her setlist spanned all her different musical outfits and the band mixed it up quite well. Going from full out rocking to full band a capella.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Anyone who knows me well knows my love and history with this man. I have been a follower since the Something Corporate days and Jack's Mannequin <em>Everything in Transit</em> is my favorite album of all time, both musically and sentimentally.  The background story is long about my love for the album and Andrew as a person, but I can say he is one of the best humans out there.</p>
            
<p>On to this album though. Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness is Andrew's latest solo outfit. The songs on here are no surprise. The only interesting aspect is that the guitars are now gone, but it is hard to notice much of a difference there.  You know what you get with Andrew, pop goodness and some damn catchy tunes. Lead single 'Cecilia and the Satellite' is in my opinion one of Andrew's best songs in a while. Its huge chorus channels those that bands like Fun have become known for. Handclaps and group vocals for days. It really is a shame Andrew hasn't quite broken out like he deserves. For some reason though I am not so sure he minds. Raising his family, traveling the world, and living in Southern California has treated him well.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: I got to see both the first and last show of Andrew's tour at the House of Blues on October 14th and the Observatory on November 29th. By my estimate this was probably the 15th and 16th time I have seen him in some form and I am in no way getting tired of it. His setlist spanned the new album as well as Something Corporate and Jack's hits. It was interesting to hear the past songs reworked without having a guitar player in the band. And since you are probably wondering, no Konstantine on this tour…</p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Against Me!: Transgender Dysphoria Blues</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>This is a very important album on two different fronts. First, this is a very important album for Against Me. Nearly 20 years ago they hit the punk scene with the ferocity that the kids always wanted. Songs about anarchy, revolution, DIY, all the essentials. As the script goes they "sold out" and eventually their songs didn't quite ring true. Basically, they needed something new to scream about.<p>
            
<p>In 2012 that something arrived. In a <em>Rolling Stone</em> article singer Tom Gabel revealed to the world that he was transgender, would be transitioning into a woman, and now go by Laura Jane Grace. While hinting at the issue in the past, Grace now had her voice. The album is truly autobiographical and uncompromising, something that truly is punk. In a year that saw the transgender conversation reach all new heights Grace got to speak her mind not only on this album, but through numerous outlets. <p>
            
<p>Amidst the chaos that is punk music Grace confesses her love to anonymous trans women dealing with discrimination and to her wife Heather who is going on this journey with her. Lines like "standing naked in front of that hotel bathroom mirror / in her dysphoria's affection, she still saw her mother's son" in song 'Paralytic States' is supposed to invoke an emotion from you. Whatever that emotion is is meant to start a conversation. </p>
            
<p>One of my favorite lines from Grace was when she was asked if her band is as fierce as it used to be. Her response: However fierce our band was in the past, imagine me, six foot two, in heels, fucking screaming in someone’s face.<p>
            
<p>Live Review: I finally got to see Against Me! at the house of Blues San Diego on May 23rd. Laura Jane did not disappoint. The ripped through about 25-30 songs with intensity and the crowd was wild the whole time. It was everything you would expect from a punk show and it was clear the band has a renewed energy and is excited for this new phase in their career.

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>In 2012 Asgeir Trausti released <em>Dyro i Dauoabogn,</em> his debut album, and since then it has only become the bestselling album in Iceland history. A very impressive feat in such a short amount of time considering the musical history of the country. This year Asgeir released an English version of the album called In the Silence as he attempts to spread his music outside of Iceland. Amongst the high falsetto that is trademark Iceland, hints of blue skies, migrating birds, long winters, fjords, and rainfall fill the lyrics. He is a man making full use of the landscapes around him and recognizing the place he comes from.</p>

<p>Despite being a 'singer-songwriter' album, In the Silence has great instrumental variety. There is the Alt-J quirkiness, the stark and calm of James Blake, the chilled out side of Of Monsters and Men, and the sleepy cabin dwelling Bon Iver. I discovered Asgeir just a few weeks before my trip and the album was perfect for driving music as I took in the grand surroundings of the country. <p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>I have noticed a trend in indie music the last few years and it's clearly based on R&ampB. Artists like Miguel, Frank Ocean, The Weekend, James Blake, FKA Twigs all had the type of sound I was noticing. Well apparently there is a term for it and it's called PBR&ampB. An awesome word(letter?)play on PBR (see:hipster) and R&ampB. How to Dress Well definitely falls into this category and it is a category I thoroughly enjoy, hipster connotation and all <p>
            
<p><em>What is this Heart?</em> is a brutally honest and emotional album that reaches soaring highs and barely audible lows. Tom Krell has a family history of depression and philosophical interests (he is working on his PhD in the field) that find themselves woven into the emotional themes of the album. Not everything is doom and gloom though as numerous songs are pop gems.<p>
            
<p>I want to speak briefly on song 'Precious Love' however. At my work, as is probably the case at your work also, cisco telephones have a hold music and damn is it catchy as all hell. Seriously, I don't mind when it comes on. There is even a <a src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4dkBF5anU">one hour loop</a> of it on youtube. Then one day I was listening to a fantastic episode of <a src="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle">This American Life</a> in which an old man spent years trying to track down the song. A year later I hear 'Precious Love' and Krell uses it as a sample! It was just too weird. Anyways, listen to this album.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: I caught How to Dress Well at the Casbah on August 21st and he was extremely impressive. Krell brings along three band members for some live music playing. It was these live instruments that bought the songs to life. Krell stands in the shadows holding two mics to quickly switch between regular and reverb mics. Armed with great video sequencing it was a very awesome show.</p>

            <p>Originating from San Diego I have been following Delta Spirit since their early days. After their folksy first album and country tinged second album the band was very vocal about shedding the Americana tag. It is no mistake that the third album was self-titled. It was the band saying "hey this is who we are, and this is what we sound like." And let me tell you the change to the new Delta Spirit is fantastic. With Into the Wide it is clear that Delta Spirit knows exactly who they are.<p>
            
<p>Two years ago the band moved to New York and a studio that was almost immediately destroyed by Hurricane Sandy. As often happens with a location change the music reflected the move and the music moved into a heavier direction. Singer Matt Vasquez's vocals are absolutely top notch and his melodies have greatly improved. The instrumentals are bombastic and big. The songs are certainly moody, but have an overall positive vibe. One grip I have had with the band in the past was that their recorded music never quite matched the intensity of their live shows. Into the Wide addressed that issue head on and I can’t wait to see them again.</p>

            <p>Chet Faker is the punny stage name for Australian Born Nicholas James Murphy. He certainly falls into the aforementioned PBR&ampB category, but adds a lot more soul to the party. Chet Faker was not originally supposed to be a thing. Murphy was a straight forward singer songwriter until one day he decided to open up his laptop and make a cover of 'No Diggity.' From there Chet Faker took off.<p>
            
<p>The album is very slickly produced. The songs are late night soul filled electronic sounds. The music is often times very sparse, but at the same time danceable, which is very refreshing. Each song also has something interesting going on musically. His trademark Rhodes piano appears throughout, but we also get some timely placed saxophone, flutes, and dabbles into jazz territory. If this is the full concentrated effort of Chet Faker then the man has a bright future and I can't wait to see what is next.<p>
            
<p>Live Review: I managed to snag a last minute ticket to Chet Faker's sold out show at the Casbah on May 31st. For someone who just recently started translating his music to a live show he was very impressive. Being just him up there he did a great job of keeping things interesting by mixing his live vocals with whatever it is they do behind the laptop and the occasional trip to the piano. The crowd was one of the worse I faced all year and you could tell Murphy felt the same. There was a bit of a rushed feel to the set.</p>

            <p>I could read about the making of this album forever. While it seems like Imogen has been quiet since her last proper release in 2009 it could not be farther from the truth. The making of this album has been stretched over that time and each song has a unique story to it. Starting with her fans sending in nearly 900 'sound seeds' to be used in song 'Lifeline', Heap began an expansive journey to stretch music to its highest capabilities.</p>
            
<p>I will just point out a few of them, but there is a full commentary version up on Spotify that is fantastic listening to those interested. Technological marvels are present in the songs in many places. 'Me, the Machine' was recorded using gestural-music wired gloves that Heap and team created. These things have to be seen to believe, they are truly amazing. 'Run-time' is a collaboration with Intel and Reality Jockey Ltd that is used in a jogging app in which the pace of the song changes with the pace of your run. 'Propeller Seeds' was recorded using 3D audio effects that is required headphone listening. </p>
            
<p>The songs also have location backstories to them as well. 'Climb to Sakteng' was partly recorded 5,000 feet high in the Himalayas. 'Xizi She Knows' was recorded throughout a six-week trip throughout China. There is even a song made in collaboration with deadmau5.</p>
            
<p>All this may sound gimmicky, but each song is patently Imogen and they surprisingly work together very well. In a time it seems technology is removing the interpersonal characteristics of our society Imogen has flipped the script. She has shown how groundbreaking technology can be used in collaboration with and to form new human interactions as she traveled the world pushing the landscape of her music.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Norwegian-born Terje Olsen has been at work releasing singles, Eps, and remixes for 10 years and this year he finally decided that it's album time. What we got here is a producer's obsession with revamping '60s lounge music, '70s disco/jazz-fusion, '80s TV show themes, and '90s electronica and sending us all on a ride in the process.</p>
            
<p><em>It's Album Time</em> features a whirlwind of influences and musical techniques. Speedy samba, Niles-Rodgers guitar, jazz noodlings, Giorgio Moroder synths, congas, and glittery house are all present here as Terje jams out for over an hour. Your only true opportunity to catch a breath on the album is smack in the middle on album highlight 'Johnny and Mary.' Sung by Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, 'Johnny and Mary' is a significantly slowed down version of the Robert Palmer original. Synth heavy, this slow burner reminds us that we all sometimes can lack a sense of proportion.</p>
            
<p>Todd Terje took ten years to craft this ride so we best grab a cocktail and let him take the controls.</p>

            <p>It's no surprise that Scott Hansen is a visual artist as well as a producer and musician. When you listen to his music it is easy to picture a setting sun, an empty seaside, or a desert plain. It's the auditory equivalent of walking around an art exhibit. Awake is the first time Hansen has recorded as a three piece band. The gained freedom has allowed Hansen to fully step into the world he was painting on his previous records. Amongst the pinpoint production, guitars float along the paths formed by a superb rhythm section.</p>
            
<p><em>Awake</em> seems to find itself in a sweet spot of soothing background music and multifaceted sonic landscape that require close listening. Hansen harnesses the power of minimal ambient textures that spread open into driving, up-lifting jams. The album invokes a sense of exploration so it lends itself perfectly to long drives, hikes, and even walks around the city. Give it a try and see what you discover. </p>
            
<p>Live Review: I caught Tycho and their full band set at the Northpark Theater on October 28th. Hansen was in full control as the conductor of the live instruments. The band soared through an hour and a half journey complete with wonderful video screens and lights. Don't miss Tycho the next time they are around.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The members of Alt-J are a bunch of geeks. There seems to be no way around that. Their music is highly technical and quirky with a very math rock feel. The lyrics allude to biblical verses, famous artists, the Wu-Tang Clan, Lou Reed, the lists go on. Often times the lyrics are criticized for making no sense at all, which may very well be true. However, in very discrete packets they are meticulously chosen and mashed together. It is a very interesting technique.</p>
            
<p>Going into <em>This is All Yours</em> Alt-J were at a very important pivot point that many bands with early success come across. Debut <em>An Awesome Wave</em> catapulted the band into the stratosphere. Winning the Mercury Prize and garnering comparisons to Radiohead will put a lot of pressure on you for your sophomore effort. Much to their respect, Alt-J avoided rinsing and repeating the success of quick paced anthems like 'Fitzpleasure' and 'Breezeblocks' and decided to bring down the tone and make a very cohesive album that works beautifully when listened to from front to back.</p>
            
<p>There are awesome moments to geek out on all over this album. Arrival in Nara/Nara/Leaving Nara weave a story of an ancient city in Japan. 'Warm Foothills' is an absolutely gorgeous song that features multiple singers not trading lines, but individual words of a verse. I have never seen it done before and it works beautifully. Miley Cyrus even creeps her way into 'Hunger of the Pine.' Alt-J has crafted a dense album worth exploring. It is clear it was meticulously worked on and now they have handed it over to us to dissect.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: I caught up with Alt-J's tour as it stopped through SOMA on October 24th. This band is so cohesive as a unit live that it often times seems as if it has to be a recording. The lights and production are absolutely on point with the music. The drumming is mesmerizing and very hard to take your eyes off of. The setlist flowed greatly between the two albums and it was a joy to listen to.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Between 2009 and 2011 Bombay Bicycle Club released 3 albums that could not have been more different then each other. There was the math-rock album, the acoustic album, and the indie album. It was as if they were telling the public "hey let us put this all out there and give us some time to go back into the workshop and figure out how we truly want this band to sound." Between 2011 and 2014 they truly figured it out.</p>
            
<p><em>So Long, See You Tomorrow</em> is a hard album to pin down. At its core it seems to be an indie album, but there is a lot more to it. The songs are inventive and creative which leads to a very varied sound. They have managed to take a very beat driven album and made it exotic and organic, escaping the pitfalls of an 'electronic indie' album. The reason for that is the incredible rhythm section of the entire album. The bass and percussion are the true driving factors. Vocals often swirl in and out taking a backseat to the instruments, which is extremely refreshing in 2014. It is no surprise that <em>So Long See You Tomorrow</em> was a 2014 Mercury Prize finalist. It is a truly refreshing and creative album, which is in my opinion what the Mercury Prize is all about. If this is the sound Bombay Bicycle Club has settled on then they have a bright future ahead of them.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: The week between Coachella's is a very glorious week for me. Looking to fill time, numerous artists make their way to San Diego and my calendar gets very booked up. I caught Bombay Bicycle Club at the Belly Up on April 17th in what was day 2 of 5 days in a row of Coachella artists in San Diego. The band played with pinpoint accuracy. I simply could not keep from watching the bass guitar player and drummer. They also brought along a female vocalist/piano player and this played very well with some of the slowed down songs from the album. An all-around great show. </p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>There were hints that this day would come for Mike Hadreas, aka Perfume Genius. The arpeggiated piano and quivering vocals of his first two albums evoked a sense of pure fragility. The delicate and sparse arrangements were veils for potent lyrics however. Themes of drugs, molestation, suicide, and abuse were all there as delicate pianos fluttered through the speakers.</p>
            
<p>During the two minute opener of 'I Decline' it looked like we would be getting another album of the same. Then it happened. 'Queen' kicks in with crashing drums, fuzzy bass, synthesized vocals and rhythmic oomphs. An important note here, only for the fact of putting context to the lyrics, is that Hadreas is openly gay and has fought addiction and body image issues as a result. 'Queen' and the album as a whole is him confronting those issues head on. 'Queen' is a defiant reaction to gay panic. The line 'no family is safe when I sashay' already feels iconic even though it has only been out a few months.</p>
            
<p>Addressing the themes of the album Hadreas states "Sometimes I see faces of blank fear when I walk by... if these fucking people want to give me some power, if they see me as some sea witch with penis tentacles that are always prodding and poking and seeking to convert the muggles--well, here she comes." This album is powerful. The departure from his quiet sound is refreshing and shocking at the same time. There are slower songs akin to the previous albums here as well. Sometimes we get both flavors in the same song. It is a great thing to see Hadreas harnessing this confidence and power and unleashing it on all of us.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: If anyone has been to the Soda Bar in San Diego they know how small of a place it is. Perfume Genius stopped by on October 17th and took full control of the room. Donned in black and red lipstick Hadreas was brilliantly confident. Alternating songs on the piano or moving around the stage in the crowds face, Hadreas was in full control. Combined with the intimacy of the venue it was a very powerful show and one that won't be soon forgotten.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Sylvan Esso, both the group and the album, is a serious study of contrasts. Singer Amelia Meath comes from folk inspired Mountain Man and producer Nick Sanborn played bass in Megafaun and recently started producing electronic music under the Made of Oak moniker. Somehow they met and from the greatness of their debut it looks like they have found their muse creating a marriage of organic and inorganic, voice and electronics. </p>
            
<p>Meath's melodies are unflappable. She creates a new and creative one in each song as the softness and smoothness of her voice bounces against the beats and production. Sanborn's production is very diverse. At times there is deep dubstep, striking counter-rhythms, and a certain buzz reminiscent of that damn thing in the kitchen making a noise and you can't figure out what it is.</p>
            
<p>A result of this juxtaposition is an album that is both cerebral and very sexy. 'H.S.K.T.' works equally well in a club as it does through headphones. 'Hey Mami' is a commentary on neighborhood catcalling. After each verse or chorus transition Sanborn layers on another bubbly disturbance as if to represent one catcall after another as Meath strolls down the street. 'Play it Right' conjures an odd marriage of Purity Ring and the Dirty projectors with its huge chorus. Sylvan Esso ultimately offer a clinic on how to make intimate electronica danceable and like the topics of coffee, sex, and dancing offered up in earworm and lead single 'Coffee' it can be addicting.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: Sometimes when you see a newer band you can witness in their eyes that they themselves can't believe how quickly their own music has caught on. Sylvan Esso at the Casbah on August 20th sold out very quickly for good reason. Both members seemed to be riding a high on their newfound popularity. Meath was magnetic as she danced around the stage with perfect pitch in her voice. Sanborn is a tall and skinny man who often times looks like a caricature on stage dancing as awkwardly as one can while being pinned to the controls. I got a feeling they won’t be at the Casbah on their next go around.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>If you are not familiar with Ryan Adams then change that quickly because he is the shit. Hands down my favorite songwriter, <em>Ryan Adams</em> is Adams' 14th release as a solo artist. 14! And the crazy part is that he may have more material then that that he hasn't even released yet. For a man that released 10 albums between 2000-2008, much was made that Adams hadn't released a proper album since 2011's <em>Ashes and Fire.</em> But to say that his pace has slowed is misleading. During that time he has run Pax Am Studio, played a lot of pinball, produced records for Fallout Boy, Jenny Lewis, Butch Walker, (side note: that record is going to be incredible and certainly on this list next year) and even scraped a 100,000 dollar album because he thought it was too sad (can we please hear this album?).</p>
            
<p>His newfound production chops shine here as the record is clean and bright. As mentioned in the Jenny Lewis review, this album recalls Tom Petty over and over again as well as the '80s in general. In 'Gimme Something Good' the organ and guitars sit nicely side by side a la Petty. The guitar tone in this album in particular recalls Mike Campbell's sultry licks. It is something that I noticed immediately. It's as if over the last 15 years Adam's has carefully calibrated a perfect mix of treble, grit, and reverb on his guitar.</p>
            
<p>You never know what you are going to get from a Ryan Adams album. Alt-country, country rock, punk, metal, acoustic ballads, and rock and roll have all found themselves their own album throughout his career. <em>Ryan Adams</em> is a perfect blend of rock n roll and the heart-wrenching ballads Adams is so good at. Songs like 'Kim' and 'My Wrecking Ball' slow down the rock and remind us that the overall sound of the album may be a mask as the lyrics are every bit as heartbreaking, confused, lost, and struggling as ever. An honest record disguised as a lie. When it comes down to it this may just be an alternate take on the album Adams wanted to make, but ultimately scrapped.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: When Adams was last in town in 2011 it was just him jumping back and forth between his guitar and piano. It was a truly stunning performance. This time around Ryan brought the band to the beautiful Copley Symphony Hall on December 15th and proceeded to bring the place down. Playing for over two hours Ryan played an awesome blend of the new album and the hits from his career. Often times the songs broke out into extended solos and outros, something that never quite happens on his records. As is the case with almost every Adams show there was interesting back and forth between Ryan and the crowd. Why can't people get the message and shut the hell up? Seeing both forms live I can't quite decide which is better and quite frankly it doesn’t matter.</p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>8 years is a long time in music and in life. That is how long it has been since Damien Rice's last album <em>9</em> came out. In 2006 the top album of the year was <em>High School Musical</em> soundtrack. Top single of the year was Daniel Powter's 'Bad Day.' I bought <em>9</em> from Best Buy during Thanksgiving break of my freshman year of college! In Rice's life 8 years was a long time as well. Sometime during the tour for <em>9</em> Rice broke up with longtime collaborator and girlfriend Lisa Hannigan. After that Rice disappeared and it is surprising that a new album appeared at all. Sometime along the way he moved to Iceland, because that's what people do to be reclusive.</p>
            
<p><em>...Fantasy</em> is an emotional wallop of an album. Coming in at only 8 songs there is over 50 minutes of music here. It is truly a beautiful album. The album lyrically seems to be a destined-to-be-unanswered-letter to Hannigan. On previous efforts her voice was a delicate and dangerous thing. The opening and title track is sung in a falsetto that is new for Rice. It is as if the song was truly written for Hannigan to sing. After that the falsetto drops out and Rice tells his stories. Stories that are frail and honest, but ultimately lead to atonement.</p>
            
<p>The length of these songs and similar formula allow for Rice to tell the full story and reach a conclusion we may not have thought we would get to at the beginning of the song. The songs start as dreary, slow tales before growing into loud, sweeping crescendos full of orchestration before the rug is pulled out from under you for one last emotional punch. Producer Rick Rubin creates a dense atmosphere instrumentally to flesh out the stories. Lush strings, acoustic and electric guitar, haunting piano are all present with many other subtleties revealing themselves through multiple listens.</p>
            
<p>I'll admit that it's is hard to get through this album completely in one listen. The songs are so dense and emotional they can quickly sap you of energy. With the length and formula of each song maybe it was never intended to. It took Rice 8 years to craft this tale, how should we be expected to take it all in in less than an hour?</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>20 years into this thing Spoon has always had a devoted group of hardcore fans that have followed them throughout their now 8th studio album. Aside from that group of cult followers Spoon have made a name for themselves the old fashioned way. In an era where a lot of artists prematurely peak commercially and artistically Spoon have slowly gotten better album after album honing in on what they are good at. After 2010's <em>Transference</em> saw their commercial success at an all-time high the band decided to take some time and decompress. Each member took on different side projects including the awesome Divine Fits album released by singer Britt Daniel.</p>
            
<p><em>They Want My Soul</em> seems to serve as a fresh start for the band. The chugging guitars, crisp hooks, and wry and incisive vocals from Daniel are as good as ever. The fresh start is achieved by the band welcoming in outside producers for the first time to take their trademark sound to the next level.</p>
            
<p>The new tricks make <em>They Want My Soul</em> Spoon's most eclectic album yet. 'Rent I Pay' is a bonafide rocker that pays tribute to The Rolling Stones. It is immediately followed by 'Inside Out' which is a mash up of synthetic strings, '80s bassline, airy harp, and a robot perfect drumbeat. There is the hi-fi of 'Rainy Taxi' and the modern drums against the acoustics of 'Knock, Knock, Knock.' The latter of which sits at the center of the album and bites you with feedback squeals bound to get the pedal heads talking.</p>
            
<p>An album full of these tricks and treats often times can lead to a mess of an album, but it is Daniel's vocals that glue the album together. Iconic in indie music for the last two decades Daniel's voice is as biting, nasally, and gritty as ever. Spoon has always been a band exceptional for making minimalism interesting. With an album like <em>They Want My Soul</em> their cult following may not be so minimal for much longer.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: I caught spoon twice this year, both in the same week actually. First time was opening for Aracde Fire on August 5th and the other at Outside Lands on August 10th. Both shows were on point and Daniel's voice sounded great. It is a bit difficult to get a full grasp on a band when seeing them in an opening or festival slot. I am looking forward to seeing them on their own terms, so fingers crossed on a headlining tour next year!</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p><em>St. Vincent</em> seemed an inevitable album by Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent. It sounds cliche, but it seems like this album was destined from the moment Clark decided to start applying her genius guitar skills to actual songs. It is the natural culmination of an artist perfecting what she is good at. The trajectory of her previous albums to this one is linear and obvious. She laid everything out on the table and flipped missteps into strengths.</p>
            
<p><em>St. Vincent</em> is ruthlessly taut and calculated. There are lush moments as well as strong powerful bursts of impact. Clark creates an alternate reality lyrically even though she insists the songs are autobiographical. We see Clark snorting coke in a bathroom stall, running around naked in Texas, personifying social media as she swallows the Earth and becomes it's leader while ultimately getting buried alive in a 'shrine of ones and zeroes.' There is a poetry and playfulness that Clark is unleashing in the stories.</p>
            
<p>Musically the 11 tracks show Clark's ability to dissect and reconstruct pop. 'Rattlesnake' is funky before it punches you with an ecstatic guitar solo. 'Huey Newton' is airy and breezy until it transitions into brutal chaos. 'Birth in Reverse' uses sludgy riffs to carry the breathless vocal melodies while 'Digital Witness' struts along to the bright brass section, a la her collaboration with David Byrne.</p>
            
<p>Let's talk about the guitar playing for a second. Clark is unbelievable at guitar. Her playing has attracted attention to magazines that hardly have the time for Pitchfork approved, female art-rockers. Exposes on Clark appear sandwiched in between the latest high gain distortion pedal and Slayer's latest release. Then it comes as a testament to Clark's confidence and control that she relegates her guitar heroics to tiny cameo roles. Don't get me wrong there is some impressive guitar work at play here. However, out of the context of the short bursts we get at the end of some songs, it is not the main focus.  This confidence marks an artist who has put it all together while at the same time having a damn good time doing it.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: St. Vincent at the House of Blues San Diego was hands down the best performance I saw all year, and it may not even be close. Clark plays up the St. Vincent persona to perfection. It is clear that you are witnessing a well thought out art performance as well as musical perfection. Unlike the albums, Clark absolutely unleashes on guitar. It was mesmerizing and beautiful. Some of the most unique and creative playing I have ever witnessed. Clark is in full control. It is a St. Vincent world and we are only living in it. </p>

          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The Antlers have never been one to truly brighten your day. Throughout their haunting and beautiful previous efforts there were songs of cancer, car accidents, scheduling your abortion, dying pets, lost love, desolation, and devastation. In fact, <em>Familiars</em> seems to be all about death, however if you give The Antlers the chance they will make that fact a little easier to bear.</p>
            
<p>Throughout the albums nine tracks it would be very tough to find something relating to a radio hit. The trio has clearly chosen a smooth, and cohesive approach to the album. Immediately apparent to this album is the expansive, lounge-jazz feel it has. Snares and cymbals careen around with brushes, mournful horn sections, and singer Peter Silberman's controlled falsetto. Silberman's vocals have always been the instrument that careened Antlers songs to new heights. On this album he carefully chooses his moments of ascension with moments where his voice essentially disappears mixing itself in with the ethereal atmosphere of the album.</p>
            
<p>The album highlight is opening track 'Palace.' It is my track of the year. The piano is beautiful and the horns are anthemic. Lines such as "Then when heaven has a line around the corner/ We shouldn't have to wait around and hope to get in/ If we can carpenter a home in our heart right now and carve a palace from within" remind us to make the most of the time that we have together. On 'Parade' Silberman adds a modern feel to an album that has timeless themes. 'But when the streets get flooded/ We'll know what proximity's worth/ 'Cause we’re already here in the same place when our phones don't work' begs the question if we are any more alive in the age of constant connectivity?</p>
            
<p>Although you will not find a chorus or traditional song structure there are straightforward songs here like the two mentioned above. Amongst them are songs that lean to their jazz influences and don't advance the albums objectives. This seems to be entirely planned as time to let the listener reflect on what they just heard and give them an opportunity to get further lost in the album's expansive and sweeping sound. The Antlers have found their groove so go ahead and get lost in it. </p>
            
<p>Live Review: I got a chance to see the Antlers for the very first time at the Belly Up on July 16th. It was as haunting and as beautiful as the albums are. Silberman shined in taking the simplicity of early songs to a full band level. Songs from <em>Familiar</em> were immersive and crisp. For an hour and a half you were able to disconnect and get lost in the music.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>This album and band caught me off guard. <em>Flesh &amp; Blood</em> is the John Butler Trio's sixth studio album. Somehow they slipped by me. I can't remember how the album ended up on my trusty iPod, but it even took me a few months to get around to it. Once I got around to it I was enthralled and excited because I had five other albums to dive into!</p>
            
<p>John Butler is a classically trained musician and the songs here are just damn good tracks that well trained trios are born to create. The songs vary across the album being driven by Butler's genius guitar playing. I didn't have much context on the album and had to do some digging to get into Butler's headspace. "This one is more like I've been on country and I've been staring at the fire, and I've been playing backgammon with my kids. It's flesh and blood in the sense that it's fallible, it's fragile, it's a human thing." I definitely agree, there is a layer of introspection, belonging, and contentment.</p>
            
<p>The songs vary throughout the album, but there are no tricks here, just a wonderful album from straight to finish from musicians at the top of their craft. It's clear Butler is a grown up kid who just loves to play his guitar and craft stories of all types through the variety that the instrument offers. In a time when some music attempts to get wrapped up in itself it's nice to hear an album that just wants to tell simple stories amongst a backdrop of elite musicianship.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The spectacular <em>Lost in the Dream</em> by Philadelphia based The War on Drugs is a classic act of turning personal hardship and catharsis into a beautiful work of art. Sure, it sounds cliche as hell, all of us have seen that movie or read that book before, but do we stop reading or watching or listening? Of course not.</p>
            
<p>Since the departure of Kurt Vile The War on Drugs has always been Adam Granduciel's project and avenue for expression. We don't need to ask him to figure out his state of mind during the making of this album. I mean just see what sad sentence you can come up with from the song titles. Here is my shot at it: 'Suffering' 'red eyes' 'under the pressure' while 'disappearing' on 'an ocean in between the waves.' The lyrical images of pain, darkness, and broken hearts are directly autobiographical to Granduciel. For two years and four different studios he obsessed over every detail of the album, only bringing in other band members one at a time.</p>
            
<p>The most surprising part of all of this is that the album is not a downer whatsoever. This is the result of an artist painstakingly working things out through his art and celebrating the results. Just look at 'An Ocean in Between the Waves.' Granduciel lets us know that he's 'in my finest hour' only to ponder the question of 'can I be more than just a fool?' and immediately answer that question through an extended instrumental outro that peaks with vocals and strings and a triumphant WOO! from Granduciel that shows itself multiple times throughout the album as if to say that even he has surprised even himself with the achievement of this record.</p>
            
<p>From a listener standpoint this is an important album in 2014 and one that we may have not known we even needed. There are gorgeous moments of influence all throughout this album as the War on Drugs make a nod to rock's past. I hear Dire Straits in 'Under the Pressure,' Tom Petty in 'Eyes to the Wind,' Stevie Nicks on 'An Ocean in Between the Waves,' Bruce on 'Burning,' and hints of Dylan throughout. None of this sounds contrived or annoying. Amongst all that are hints of newer sounds and tones of moving on. It as if the band is making a nod to the past, strapping their stringed instruments and real drums on their back and taking the reins.</p>
            
<p><em>Lost in the Dream</em> is America at its best. It's music to get lost in, music to road trip to, music to listen to at the campfire as you read Kerouac, music to help you get over. A true testament to getting off your ass and making something special.</p>
            
<p>Live Review: I saw The War on Drugs twice in 2014 in two very different settings. April 6th headlining at the Casbah and helping The Flaming Lips close down Iceland Airwaves in Reykjavik on November 9th. It was a joy to see the band jam out in the intimacy of the Casbah, but was equally exciting to see them amped up for a unique show in Iceland, which was apparently their first trip to the country. The War on Drugs are clearly riding the high of their most successful album to date. </p>

            <h4 class="modal-title">Copeland: Ixora</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>Copeland sure did choose an interesting day to announce their triumphant return. On April 1st Aaron Marsh dropped a video featuring Copeland rocking out with the slow, piano ballad of 'Ordinary' playing over the scene. They were back.</p>
            
<p>Copeland used a crowd funding strategy to get the album recorded and distributed through numerous pre-order bundles. After convincing myself that this wasn’t all a cruel joke the six month wait started. After first listen there was never a doubt the album would be my top album of the year.</p>
            
<p>A little bit of back story on Copeland. Their debut <em>Beneath Medicine Tree</em> came out when I was a freshman in high school in 2003 and they were truly one of the first bands I got very into. <em>Ixora,</em> their fifth release, was an album I never thought would come out. In my opinion, Copeland has the most complete album catalogue out of any band I listen to. There is only one song I don’t enjoy (why did you have to write 'Kite' Aaron?) and I had full faith <em>Ixora</em> wouldn’t change that. I had a chance to watch Copeland progress and come into their own after seeing them 5-6 times when they were traveling regularly.</p>
            
<p>On to the music. 'Have I Always Loved You?' plays like the band is slowing revealing themselves from behind a curtain. Aaron and his guitar kick off the song and as it progresses, each instrument starts in one at a time to reveal the return. Lyrically the song reads as a self-reflection on one's place in a relationship. However, it also works as a reflection on the music of Copeland. It's about returning to the thing you love, simply because of love, and achieving that return despite all the roadblocks in the way. 'Disjointed' immediately follows and this is Copeland declaring with confidence that they have a better grasp on who they are then most bands will ever strive for in a lifetime. Much to its title it kicks off with seemingly disparate synths, a simple kickdrum, delicate xylophone, and harmonious piano chords. It moves forward into continuity and emotional integrity amid Marsh's soaring falsetto.</p>
            
<p>There is beauty completely surrounding this album. 'Chiromancer' again shows Marsh's ability to find unknown female talent and weave it perfectly in with his own vocals. 'World Turn' features an unexpected and wonderful saxophone solo. Copeland have always been great at closing tracks. 'In Her Arms You Will Never Starve' reflects the album’s cover of oceans and waves and discusses the idea of relinquishing control and letting things just be. </p>
            
<p>The aforementioned 'Ordinary' is bare and simple, giving Marsh an opportunity to speak of embracing the mundaneness and routines that come with growing old. While this is certainly a relevant topic as we all grow older I think it is the message of 'I Can Make You Feel Young Again' that Copeland most effectively gets across. "I can make you feel young again/ I can make you feel nothing at all for the years that led you here." Many fans have a personal relationship with Copeland and after 11 years since the band's debut a lot has changed, but for 45 minutes Aaron Marsh and crew want to help you feel young again. Mission accomplished.</p>
